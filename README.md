Code Challenge

## Overview

The **Fix My Code Challenge** repository is designed to enhance debugging and code analysis skills. Each challenge presents a piece of code with intentional errors or inefficiencies, and the objective is to identify and rectify these issues to ensure optimal functionality.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a distinct challenge:

- **0x01-challenge**: Contains a JavaScript script that requires debugging to function as intended.

Each directory includes:

- **Source Code**: The original code with embedded issues.
- **README.md**: A description of the challenge, outlining the expected behavior and any constraints.

## Installation

To set up the challenges locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realjioke/Fix_My_Code_Challenge.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the specific challenge directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge  # Replace with the desired challenge directory
   ```

## Usage

1. **Review the Challenge**:
   - Read the `README.md` file in the challenge directory to understand the problem statement and expected behavior.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - Examine the provided source code to identify bugs, errors, or inefficiencies.

3. **Implement Fixes**:
   - Modify the code to correct the issues.

4. **Test the Solution**:
   - Run the code to ensure it behaves as expected after your modifications.

## Example

For the **0x01-challenge**:

1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge
   ```
2. **Run the original script**:
   ```bash
   node original_script.js
   ```
   - Observe the incorrect behavior or errors.
3. **Edit the script**:
   - Open the script in your preferred code editor and apply necessary fixes.
4. **Test the fixed script**:
   ```bash
   node fixed_script.js
   ```
   - Confirm that the output aligns with the expected behavior described in the `README.md`.
